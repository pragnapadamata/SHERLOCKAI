# 🏭 Tata Steel Autonomous Plant Intelligence System (Sherlock)

## 🚀 Overview

Sherlock (Autonomous Plant Intelligence System) is a multi-agent AI platform designed to help steel plants reduce downtime, improve safety, optimize energy consumption, and support executive decision-making.

The system leverages LangGraph-based AI agents, live operational simulations, and an enterprise-grade dashboard to transform raw plant data into actionable intelligence.

Built as a hackathon solution for Tata Steel.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern steel plants generate enormous amounts of operational data from:

* Equipment sensors
* Safety monitoring systems
* Maintenance logs
* Production systems
* Energy consumption trackers

Organizations face challenges such as:

* Unexpected equipment failures
* Worker safety incidents
* Rising energy costs
* Production bottlenecks
* Slow management reporting

Sherlock addresses these challenges using AI-powered autonomous agents and intelligent analytics.
